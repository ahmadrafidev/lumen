## Overview

Lumen enables designers and developers to assess and improve the accessibility of their color choices. With a focus on meeting Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards, the app provides valuable insights for creating color combinations that are readable and inclusive for all users.

## Core Features

### Input Color Selection
- **Multiple Input Options**: Enter color values by:
  - Typing hex codes.
  - Using a color picker.
  - Inputting RGB or HSL values.
  
### Contrast Ratio Calculation
- **WCAG Compliance**: Calculates the contrast ratio between two colors based on WCAG guidelines, with results for:
  - **AA Level**: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text.
  - **AAA Level**: Minimum 7:1 for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text.

### Accessibility Pass/Fail Feedback
- **Feedback Indicators**: Displays whether the selected color combination meets AA or AAA standards.
  - Uses visual indicators (e.g., checkmarks or red X's) for quick, intuitive feedback.

### Suggestions for Improved Contrast
- **Color Adjustment Suggestions**: If a combination fails, suggests lighter or darker shades to meet contrast standards.
- **Automatic Recalculation**: Automatically recalculates contrast for suggested colors, ensuring compliance.

### Color Blindness Simulation
- **Simulate Color Blindness**: Preview how colors appear to users with common types of color blindness (e.g., protanopia, deuteranopia).
- **Enhanced Inclusivity**: Ensures color choices are distinguishable for all audiences.

## Additional Features

### Real-time Preview
- **Sample Text Display**: View a live preview of text with selected colors, simulating a real webpage or mobile screen.
- **Text Size Toggle**: Test contrast across different text sizes to see if it holds up in various contexts.

### WCAG Guidelines and Tips
- **Educational Resource**: Provides an overview of WCAG contrast guidelines and explains the importance of color contrast in accessible design.
